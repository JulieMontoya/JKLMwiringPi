#  What still needs doing:
#
#  Re-image a new micro-SD card with a pristine Raspbian install, and determine EXACTLY what else needs
#  installing to make this work.
#  Update notes accordingly.
#  
#  Add a ->read_vector() method, for reading A-to-D converters and similar.
#    (no:  Better idea!  Change the behaviour of digital_read when called in scalar context,
#          so it creates a vector from each bit read.)
#
#####  Turn explanatory comments into proper POD --  this is done now.
#
#  Create methods to set and clear pull-up and pull-down resistors on inputs.
#
#  Obtain a 23017 I2C GPIO expenaion IC, and get the appropriate extensions to work.
#  (The underlying WiringPi library might even take care of this itself.)
